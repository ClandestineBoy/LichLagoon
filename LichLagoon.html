A ship travels across the map Indiana Jones style; the map is of the West Indies, and zooms in as a narrator comes in. The narrator’s text box says that they are the player.//

November 19, 1645, 

We’ve lurked in Paladin territory for some time now. Perhaps too long. Captain Jones knows this, but we remain. Storming, bombarding, raiding, growing. We’re hunted, as all pirates are, but we are a valued target. Paladins don’t take kindly to the undead. They will find us, three days at most, but there is business left in these waters. I must take care of it and swiftly, if we hope to make it out alive.

[[Start Game]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Start Game" tags="" position="409,355" size="100,100">//The game then fades to black, and fades back into a first-person perspective; the player is sitting in a rowboat, travelling away from a ship into a foggy sea. Three undead sit (as portraits) in the rowboat with you. They look to you and a group conversation occurs. When the conversation below ends,//

**Robin:**
You&#39;ve gotta run me through this just one more time.

[[We&#39;ve been through this. Four times (Skip tutorial)]]
[[Okay but please, listen.]]

Well excuse me. It&#39;s my first time, I&#39;m nervous. 

**Gunlaug** 
We are all new to this. Yet here we sit, silent. 

**Robin**
Okay... okay. Sorry.
//Robin shifts their weight, excitedly//

[[Arrive at the island]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Okay but please, listen." tags="" position="511,494" size="100,100">**Robin**
I will try my very best. 

**Gunlaug**
Do more than try. My ears ache.

**Robin**
I don&#39;t think you have ears anymore...

**Player**
Okay, so you died. Sorry. But thanks to The Captain, you&#39;re now a Lich, undead. 

**Robin**
That explains a lot.

**Player**
All Lich&#39;s, if they so please, have the opportunity to join Captain Jones&#39;s crew, the most formidable pirates this side of the afterlife. 

**Francesca**
So we&#39;re criminals and a profligates?

**Player**
If you like. Either way, you&#39;re tied to this dwelling now. And thus, you are  prey. Paladin&#39;s don&#39;t see undead, they see monsters. So we need to find a way of keeping you alive, wether you join us or not. That&#39;s where I can lend a hand. 

**Gunlaug**
You forge armor? 

**Player**
Of a sort. Your body is purely a vessel, animated but decaying. A dead body cannot sustain a living soul, yet without one you are merely flesh. So we take the soul and store it elsewhere, an object to house your spirit, a phylactory. Once the soul is stored, your body becomes preseved and indestructible... to a point. This is my task, wether you join our crew or not, I will find you a phylactory. 

**Francesca**
And what if we refuse your help?

[[Nobody has done that before]]
[[You will die]]
[[You will be hunted]]



</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="You will die" tags="" position="491,653" size="100,100">**Player**
Well without a phylactery you will decompose in a week at best. That is assuming the Paladin&#39;s don&#39;t get to you first.

**Francesca**
I welcome their arrival. 

**Player**
You won&#39;t be spared. I&#39;ve seen Paladin&#39;s slay their own countless times before, you will fall a similar fate without our help.

**Francesca**
So be it. 

**Robin**
So why you? I wanna pick what my soul goes into, it&#39;s my damn soul. Will a soul fit inside a cannon ball? 

**Player**
Well yes... but that&#39;s not exactly the point. You see a soul has to resonate with its phylactery so you can&#39;t just stick it into anything. Objects and souls have histories and those histories need to form balance, else the phylactery will corrupt. I can see these histories, it&#39;s my gift. Objects reveal things to me and thus, I find phylacteries for our newest recruits. 

**Gunlaug**
How can we help?

**Player**
Well, tell me your feelings. The better I know you, the better home I can find for your soul.

**Gunlaug**
I cannot assist.

**Francesca**
You&#39;ll have to torture me.

**Robin**
See I still think a cannonball is gonna be the best home for me. 

**Player**
This is going to be interesting...

Paladin&#39;s have been tracking undead for centuries, almost wiped us all out. You are now a target, they won&#39;t hestitate, Paladin armor or not. 

**Francesca**
I&#39;m aware. 

**Player**
I&#39;m sure you are. But realize they have abandoned you now, I advise you do the same. 

**Francesca**
You must think me to be a fool, employing conversion tactics on a soldier. I don&#39;t break, pirate.

**Player**
Either way, without a phylactery your body will rot within days. 

**Francesca**
So I&#39;ll find my own.

**Robin** 
Yeah same here. Thanks for the ride to shore but I&#39;m pretty set on a cannon ball as a soul house. 

**Player**
It&#39;s not that simple. You see a soul has to resonate with its phylactery so you can&#39;t just stick it into anything.

Ummm... Well. Nobody&#39;s ever refused my help before. I would highly recommend you take it. 

**Francesca**
And why&#39;s that?

**Player**
Well, without a phylactery you will decompose in three days at best. And even if you try to find one alone, I doubt you&#39;d manage to find anything suitable. 

**Francesca**
I&#39;ll do just fine without the help of a pirate. 

**Robin**
As will I, no offence. I&#39;m just pretty set on a cannon ball.

**Gunlaug**
Anvil.

**Player**
All fine suggestions, I&#39;m sure. The problem is you must consider resonance. 

**Robin**
Like a guitar?

**Player**
Almost, see a soul has to resonate with its phylactery so you can&#39;t just stick it into anything. Objects and souls have histories and those histories need to form balance, else the phylactery will corrupt. I can see these histories, it&#39;s my gift.

**Gunlaug**
You create harmony, I see. How can we help?

**Player**
Well, tell me your feelings. The better I know you, the better home I can find for your soul.

I cannot assist.

You&#39;ll have to torture me.

**Player**
Okay, so this will be our home until I find each of you a suitable phylactery.

**Gunlaug**
Significant improvements must be made. 

**Robin**
Just try to enjoy the fresh air. 

**Francesca**
Pirate. I will stay for my phylactery but remember I owe you nothing and once I have what I need, I will leave. 

**Player**
I understand. Let&#39;s begin.
